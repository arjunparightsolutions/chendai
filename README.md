# ChendAI 🥁
**A Research under Right Solutions by Arjun P A**

**AI-Powered Traditional Kerala Percussion Beat Generator**

ChendAI is an intelligent music generation system that creates authentic traditional Kerala percussion beats using AI composition and advanced audio synthesis. This project is a research initiative exploring "DNA-based music generation" technology.

## 🧬 Helix-Harmony Mode (DNA-Based Music Generation)

ChendAI introduces **Helix-Harmony Mode**, a groundbreaking approach where musical instruments are defined by their "DNA" - a set of fundamental synthesis parameters (frequency, harmonics, decay, texture) that constitute the "genetic code" of the sound.

Just as biological DNA defines an organism, our **Instrument DNA** files (`chendadna.txt`, `illathalamdna.txt`, etc.) define the acoustic soul of each instrument. The AI composes the "sheet music", and the Helix-Harmony engine breathes life into it by synthesizing audio in real-time based on these genetic definitions.
